# DQN with Model-Based Exploration
We proposed Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with model-based exploration, an algorithm
combining both model-free and model-based approaches that
explores better and learns environments with sparse rewards more efficiently.
Detail can be found in the paper: DQN with Model-based exploration.pdf.

### Run the code:
- Make sure to have installed necessary packages in your python environment.
- run train_model.py to train.
